                    This header tab I would like to use to do a little about me section that is more personal
                    than professional, then use my nav to link the other documents
                </p>
            </section>
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>
            within the footer I would maybe leave quick links to contact me
        </p>
    </footer>
